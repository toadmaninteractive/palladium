    <h1>What are the events?</h1>
    <p>Every game project has a number of <strong>events</strong> that are <strong>triggered</strong> when a <strong>certain behavior is observed.</strong></p>

    <p>Every <strong>event</strong> has a number of <strong>parameters</strong> that store the game state.<br/>
        Ex.: event_name: session_id, account_id, datetime, match_id.. etc
    </p>
    <p>
        When an event is triggered, <strong>parameter values</strong> from a particular game client are being sent to the analytics database.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here you can find a <strong>list of all event</strong> that is assigned to the project.<br/>
        Some of them can be not implemented/tested/activated.
    </p>
